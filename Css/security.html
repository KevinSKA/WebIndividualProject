                <p>
                    With the increasing popularity of the web, more and more people are depending on it for nearly every aspect of their 
                    daily lives, be it jobs, banking, shopping and storing personal information. This made the internet a prime suspect 
                    for cyber threats. As sensitive data are being exchanged, the web's security has become a necessity. Without proper 
                    safeguards and precautions, users risk falling victim to multiple cyberattacks. 
                </p>

                <h2>Common Cyber Attacks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hacking by remote access:</strong> Hackers try and exploit systems or networks so they can steal information and data. 
                        Another target for hackers is RDP (remote desktop protocol), which lets users access a computer from the internet. 
                        Hackers try and exploit this system to gain access to devices and may take data or sell it on the dark web. </li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Phishing is the most popular form of cyberattack to this day. 
                        Hackers send messages and emails to people disguising themselves as famous companies or colleagues, 
                        and trick them into pressing a link or an attachment. By doing that, people risk giving away data, or 
                        downloading a malware. </li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Malware:</strong> A malware is a software that is designed to gain access to a computer or even damage it, 
                        like a virus or a trojan. It is distributed by either phishing as mentioned before, or by malvertising, 
                        where malware is distributed online by ads or on websites that could download a malware if interacted with. </li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A Ransomware is a type of malware that instead of damaging a computer, 
                        restricts parts of it, mainly data. As the name indicates, a ransom is then demanded to release it.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi threats:</strong> When a wi-fi is public, risks come with it, since it often lacks security, 
                        making it easy on hackers to monitor your online usage, and steal information and passwords.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Safe Practices</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, one should always be aware of any links, files or QR codes before opening. 
                    In addition, one should use their information very carefully on suspicions websites, especially 
                    when it comes to passwords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important factor to consider is a strong password. Below is a table by hive 
                    systems that shows the time it takes hackers to brute force your password, according to the table, 
                    it is best to create a password that takes a lot of time to breach, in addition of enabling 2 factor 
                    authentication if possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Installing a good antivirus is also essential for every computer, 
                    it would help scan for any viruses, enable VPN when surfing the internet on public networks 
                    for increased security, enabling a firewall to keep suspicious downloads or websites 
                    from invading the computer, and much more.
