                    CSS one of the main programming languages used in web design, and is mostly focused on the Styling of the website. 
                    But how did it come to exist?
                    “CSS was first introduced after the creation of Html by Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie who was 
                    also working at CERN” [4]. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1996 the first version of CSS called CSS1 was adopted, with internet explorer being the first commercial 
                    web browser to support it. 2 years after that, the newer version CSS2 was released, and was an improvement, 
                    supporting multiple devices including hand held and televisions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS3 was released in 2011, and introduced new functionalities like modules which helped users reuse 
                    code with its own style, and improved the safety by applying the CSS rules locally rather than globally. 
                    It also came with responsive design and many other improvements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, CSS became a living standard, so now, snapshots are being released, which do not change any core functionality, 
                    just making it better and easier to use.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    After the release of Html 5.1, Html became a living standard, and instead of releasing new versions, 
                    it is continuously updated. And as of September 2025, there is no official information about the release of Html 6.

                <p>
                    <br>
                    In the early days of the web, URLs were ASCII only, meaning it only included English letters and numbers and some symbols. 
                    After the creation of the currently used UTF-8, Arabic characters could be used in URLs but were not displayed correctly.
                    <br> 
                    Around 2003, IDN and Punycode were introduced, making Arabic characters fully integrated in the URLs, with .مصر (Egypt)
                    being one of the first Arabic domains.

                <summary>CSS @ Rules</summary> 
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The at-rule in CSS is consisted from an “@” followed by a keyword, that tells the CSS how to behave. 
                    Most of the at-rules are loaded first before the rest of the CSS file.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some examples may be:
                    <br>
                    @charset ; to define the character set used (Usually UTF-8).
                    <br>
                    @import; it is used if needed to import an external CSS file. 
                    <br><br>
                    These rules are not only used at the top of the file, some like @media are used around normal CSS rules.
