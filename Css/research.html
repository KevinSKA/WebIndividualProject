                    CSS one of the main programming languages used in web design, and is mostly focused on the Styling of the website. 
                    But how did it come to exist?
                    “CSS was first introduced after the creation of Html by Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie who was 
                    also working at CERN” [4]. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1996 the first version of CSS called CSS1 was adopted, with internet explorer being the first commercial 
                    web browser to support it. 2 years after that, the newer version CSS2 was released, and was an improvement, 
                    supporting multiple devices including hand held and televisions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS3 was released in 2011, and introduced new functionalities like modules which helped users reuse 
                    code with its own style, and improved the safety by applying the CSS rules locally rather than globally. 
                    It also came with responsive design and many other improvements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, CSS became a living standard, so now, snapshots are being released, which do not change any core functionality, 
                    just making it better and easier to use.

                    <br>
                    After the release of Html 5.1, Html became a living standard, and instead of releasing new versions, 
                    it is continuously updated. And as of September 2025, there is no official information about the release of Html 6.
