          <summary>CSS History</summary>
          <p>
            <br />
            CSS one of the main programming languages used in web design, and is
            mostly focused on the Styling of the website. But how did it come to
            exist? “CSS was first introduced after the creation of Html by
            Norwegian technologist Håkon Wium Lie who was also working at CERN”
            [4].
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1996 the first version of CSS called CSS1 was adopted, with
            internet explorer being the first commercial web browser to support
            it. 2 years after that, the newer version CSS2 was released, and was
            an improvement, supporting multiple devices including hand held and
            televisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS3 was released in 2011, and introduced new functionalities like
            modules which helped users reuse code with its own style, and
            improved the safety by applying the CSS rules locally rather than
            globally. It also came with responsive design and many other
            improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, CSS became a living standard, so now, snapshots are being
            released, which do not change any core functionality, just making it
            better and easier to use.

          <summary>HTML Newest Version</summary>
          <p>
            <br />
            After the release of Html 5.1, Html became a living standard, and
            instead of releasing new versions, it is continuously updated. And
            as of September 2025, there is no official information about the
            release of Html 6.
          </p>

          <summary>Arabic In URLs</summary>
          <p>
            <br />
            In the early days of the web, URLs were ASCII only, meaning it only
            included English letters and numbers and some symbols. After the
            creation of the currently used UTF-8, Arabic characters could be
            used in URLs but were not displayed correctly.
            <br />
            Around 2003, IDN and Punycode were introduced, making Arabic
            characters fully integrated in the URLs, with .مصر (Egypt) being one
            of the first Arabic domains.

          <summary>CSS @ Rules</summary>
          <p>
            <br />
            The at-rule in CSS is consisted from an “@” followed by a keyword,
            that tells the CSS how to behave. Most of the at-rules are loaded
            first before the rest of the CSS file.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some examples may be:
            <br />
            @charset ; to define the character set used (Usually UTF-8).
            <br />
            @import; it is used if needed to import an external CSS file.
            <br /><br />
            These rules are not only used at the top of the file, some like
            @media are used around normal CSS rules.

          <summary>How Do Websites Keep Passwords Secure?</summary>
          <p>
            <br />
            Keeping your password safe is the most important thing when it comes
            to cyber security. Websites achieve that by hashing the passwords
            before being sent to the server, using hashing algorithms like
            SHA256 or SHA512. Hashing is a mathematical function that transfers
            input data into a string. Unlike Encryption, once hashing is used,
            data can't be returned to its original value making it better for
            password storage.

            <br />
            Correct password handling is not always implemented correctly by
            websites, so to combat that, users must have these habits: 
            <ul>
              <li>Always use strong unique passwords, and not using the same password for everything.</li>
              <li>Enable two factor authentication as an added layer of security in case of a data breach or improper data handling.</li>
              <li>Heed to browser warnings about unsafe connection.</li>
              <li>Sign in with Google (or others like Apple and Facebook) which is generally a better and safer way to log in.</li>
            </ul>
