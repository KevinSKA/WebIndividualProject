                    A web browser is an application that connects users to the vast amount of information and services
                    available on the World Wide Web. It displays web pages in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and more,
                    this allows users to view and navigate the data in a clear and seamless way.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, web browsers are considered to be essential daily tools that are used everywhere like for 
                    entertainment, education, work and many more online services. This made web browsers indispensable tools, 
                    used by billions worldwide. Popular browsers include Chrome, Fire Fox, Microsoft Edge, and many more.

                    But it was not like this in the past, before web browsers were a thing, people accessed the internet using 
                    command-line interfaces, making internet surfing much more challenging. This changed in 1989, when scientist 
                    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working in CERN. He was given the task of automating information 
                    sharing among CERN scientists, which was a huge international research center with thousands of employees across 
                    different countries, making it essential to have an intuitive, and easy to use platform to share information. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, along with systems engineer Robert Cailliau had the first Web browser working at CERN, 
                    and it was called WorldWideWeb, which was renamed to Nexus later on. It was a simple platform, but it helped lay the 
                    foundation of how people will interact on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993, the Mosaic browser was created at the university of Illinois, and was the first browser to support the 
                    usage of images on the web making the web more engaging and user friendly. This change increased the public interest 
                    in browsers; this inspired the creation of Netscape. In 1994, Netscape became the first browser that became public, 
                    and soared in popularity, because of its speed and ease to use at its time. This caused the “Browser Wars” in the late 
                    1990s were Netscape and Internet explorer competed. Internet explorer went on and “won” the war, gaining around 90% of 
                    the market share.
                </p>
                 <p>
                   According to StatCounter, Internet Explorer was the most used browser in the early 2000s, but that changed around 2008, 
                   when Chrome was first released, and since then, it has been in the lead, with a market share of over 65% as of 2025 [1].

                <p>
                    With the increase in web browsers, the websites also skyrocketed in popularity going from just a few thousands in 
                    the early 1990s, to millions in a couple of years. This growth was fueled by the rise of online services, and as more
                    and more people gained access to the internet, the potential of online presence became more apparent, leading to a 
                    surge in website creation, and according to Internet Live Stats as of 2018, the number of websites exceeded 1.5 billion.

                <p>
                   Looking ahead into the future, web browsers are likely to become more AI integrated, allowing it to be more tailored to 
                   the user's needs, suggest and automate tasks. It would also become more seamless and faster. 
                   Another future upgrade could be the usage of Cloud Computing, where the browsers can process tasks 
                   in remote servers and not on the device, making it faster and better for lower-end devices. 
                   Browsers could also increase the immersive technologies by integrating AR and VR, rendering the 
                   platforms more interactive.
