                    Everywhere, including in the Middle East, the Internet has become a necessary part of daily life. 
                    In recent years, the region has seen a rise in internet usage due to a number of factors, including the digital 
                    transformation, rising smartphone technology, and rising demand for online services. 
                    This is due to a number of reasons like remote jobs, online learning, e-commers, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In Lebanon in particular, internet usage has been rising steadily despite infrastructure and economic challenges.

                <h2>Mobile internet market:</h2>
                <p>
                    According to Statista “as of 2024, the UAE had the second-fastest average mobile internet speed 
                    in the world, ranking after Qatar” [3]. 
                    However, Syria and Lebanon for example rank above the 85% mark according to SpeedTest.
                </p>
                <h2>Fixed Broadband internet market:</h2>
                <p>
                    Similarly to mobile speeds, according to SpeedTest data, Qatar, UAE, and Kuwait 
                    rank in the top 30 for fasted internet, whereas Syria and Lebanon are in the 150 range. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These stats show the vast disparity between middle eastern counties when it comes to internet technology and speeds.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Lebanon, 90% of the population has used the internet at least once according to Internet 
                    Society's data, with Asia's average being 62%.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internet Society also created an Internet Resilience Index, which measures how well a 
                    country can cope with disruptions, maintain a good and stable service, resist attacks and more.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lebanon's internet resilience score is 38/100, which is a bit low compared to the global average of 45/100, 
                    but far better than the worst in the middle east which is Syria with a score of 17/100. 
                    Qatar on the other hand, has the best score in the middle east with a score of 58/100.   
                </p>
                <p>
                   However, Lebanon has the best freedoms on the net in the middle east with a score of 50/100 according to 
                   Freedom House's data. Other countries in the middle east like UAE, Iran, 
                   and Saudi Arabia have a low score below 30/100.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is due to a number of factors including the restrictions a lot of Arab countries put on users like 
                    Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE regulating and blocking many platforms such as 
                    WhatsApp, Skype, and some news outlets. Other factors include political stability and security, 
                    where governments block harmful information by using firewalls, internet shutdowns, and even arrests 
                    for online speech. <br>
                    These factors highly affect the internet usage and freedom in many middle eastern countries.
